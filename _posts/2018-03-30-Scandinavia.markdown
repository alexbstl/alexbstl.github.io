The last few days have been a bit of a blur, on a whirlwind trip through Sweden and Norway with stops in Stockholm, Stavanger, Bergen, and Oslo.  Interspersed, I went hiking at perhaps the most beautiful place in the world (the Preikestolen, a sheer cliff sitting 2000 feet above a fjord) tried Reindeer sausage (sorry, Rudolph), and have spent untold amounts of money on food (Norway is *really* expensive). In truth, I'm just glad to be away on vacation for a few days.  Anyways, here's a photo from the Preikestolen: ![Preikestolen Scene]({{ "/assets/Hike1.jpeg" | absolute_url }})
