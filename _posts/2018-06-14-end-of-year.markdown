Well, my first year at UCSB is officially (almost) over!  I have one more exam in August, but that's a minor detail.  Time to prep for qualifiers, so it'll be a long busy summer, but that's alright.  I'm looking forward to a traveling to Iceland then onto Dublin for the Bachelier Finance Society Conference at Trinity College.  An article I worked on with Professor Feinstein, [Dynamic Clearing and Contagion in Financial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02091) was accepted for a session there, so I will be attending.
