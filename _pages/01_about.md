Hi! I'm Alex and i'm currently a graduate student in Probability and Applied Statistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  I did my Undergrad in Economics and Mathematics and did a Masters in Applied Mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis where I also worked with <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/orfe">Zachary Feinstein</a> on Systemic Risk in Financial Networks.  I have also previously worked at <a href="http://www.epic.com/">Epic Systems</a> in the Technical Services role.

Aside from my academic/career life, I am also an avid rock climber and skier.
